# Etch-A-Sketch
This is a simple Etch-A-Sketch web application. 

To draw, click and hold the mouse down. To erase, click the 'Clear Sketch' button. To change color, use the color wheel.
There are many problems and possible bugs including a noticable error when the mouse is held down while it leaves the canvas. Resulting in a hands-free drawing mode.
